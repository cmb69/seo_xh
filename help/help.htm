        While CMSimple_XH allows to easily set up a web site, these are often not <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">optimized for search
        engines</a>. Seo_XH allows to reduce duplicate content issues, and to have
        proper heading structures.

    </section>

    <section id="settings">
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>
            The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the
            website's back-end. Select "Seo" from "Plugins".
        </p>
        <p>
            You can change the default settings of Seo_XH in "Config". Hints for the options will be
            displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Localization is done in "Language". You can translate the character strings to your own
            language, or customize them according to your needs.
        </p>
        <!--<p>The look of Pagemanager_XH can be customized in "Stylesheet". Particularly,
you should look for the settings that are commented out. Maybe you like to try
them.</p>-->
    </section>

    <section id="usage">
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <section id="usage-redirections">
            <h3>Redirections</h3>
            <p>
                In the plugin configuration there are several settings which allow to enforce
                certain conventions for requesting pages of the CMSimple_XH installation to
                partially avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_content">duplicate
                content</a>. Note that it is more efficient to let the web server do these
                redirections, though, in which case the redirections of Seo_XH should be disabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to use Seo_XH's redirections, make sure to configure and test whether
                everything works as desired while "Permanent" is disabled. <em>After</em> you're
                finished enable "Permanent"; otherwise the duplicate content won't be avoided. Note
                that browsers usually cache permanent redirects, so changing the settings afterwards
                may not have the desired result; in the worst case a browser might end in an
                infinite redirection loop.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="usage-canonical">
            <h3>Canonical Links</h3>
            <p>
                Seo_XH automatically creates <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element">canonical links</a> for
                the pages, if enabled in the configuration. To get proper canonical links, you have
                to set up redirections as described in the previous section. If CMSimple_XH is
                installed without additional plugins, the canonical links are suppossed to work out
                of the box. Some plugins, for instance Realblog_XH and lb_Gallery, present different
                content on the same page what is controlled by additional query parameters. If
                you're using such a plugin, make sure to add the respective query parameter names to
                the configuration option Canonical→Include.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="usage-headings">
            <h3>Heading Structure</h3>
            <p>
                With the default configuration, the plugin automatically warns about irregular
                heading structures, if such are found.
            </p>
            <p>
                If all the heading structures are correct, there's still an issue for sites where
                menu_levels is configured to be greater than 1, namely that there may be a gap in
                the heading structure. If you want to fix that, what is strongly recommended for SEO
                purposes, you have to make a small change to your template. Find the following line:
            </p>
            <pre>&lt;?php echo content()?&gt;</pre>
            <p>and replace it with:</p>
            <pre>&lt;?php echo seo_headings(content())?&gt;</pre>
            <p>
                Note that this only affects the HTML of the content area, but not other parts of the
                page, such as newsboxes. Also note that the headings are dynamically adjusted, but
                the actual content is not changed, so depending on the CSS the rendered page might
                look different to the preview in the WYSIWYG editor.

        While CMSimple_XH allows to easily set up a web site, these are often not optimized for SEO
        purposes. Seo_XH offers some tools to improve the situation. For now the plugin is concerned
        with the structure of the headings only.
    </p>

    <section id="requirements">
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Seo_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.6 and PHP &ge; 5.3.0.

    </section>

    <section id="settings">
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>
            The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the
            website's back-end. Select "Seo" from "Plugins".
        </p>
        <p>
            You can change the default settings of Seo_XH in "Config". Hints for the options will be
            displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Localization is done in "Language". You can translate the character strings to your own
            language, or customize them according to your needs.
        </p>
        <!--<p>The look of Pagemanager_XH can be customized in "Stylesheet". Particularly,
you should look for the settings that are commented out. Maybe you like to try
them.</p>-->

    <section id="usage">
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <section id="usage-headings">
            <h3>Heading Structure</h3>
            <p>
                With the default configuration, the plugin automatically warns about irregular
                heading structures, if such are found.
            </p>
            <p>
                If all the heading structures are correct, there's still an issue for sites where
                menu_levels is configured to be greater than 1, namely that there may be a gap in
                the heading structure. If you want to fix that, what is strongly recommended for SEO
                purposes, you have to make a small change to your template. Find the following line:
            </p>
            <pre>&lt;?php echo content()?&gt;</pre>
            <p>and replace it with:</p>
            <pre>&lt;?php echo seo_headings(content())?&gt;</pre>
            <p>
                Note that this only affects the HTML of the content area, but not other parts of the
                page, such as newsboxes. Also note that the headings are dynamically adjusted, but
                the actual content is not changed, so depending on the CSS the rendered page might
                look different to the preview in the WYSIWYG editor.
